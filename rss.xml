When you can't have a fire, the next best thing is a fire in a flask. Here's the recipe for the mixologist in you.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/61b31e7329d9521e39e30d7f810f2557d817368f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How A Man's Fitbit Got Him The Medical Care He Needed</h1><p>On Jan. 5, a man checked into a hospital's emergency room in Camden, New Jersey. Because his heart was beating irregularly, doctors suspected he had atrial fibrillation, the most common type of arrhythmia, which can increase the risk of stroke. But to decide how to treat him, they needed to know exactly how long his heart had been acting up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2540bffcfc76dfb2a5e2975d8809099dcd0b592c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to Build a Solid Drinking Library</h1><p>Are there places I like as much as great bars? Yes: great bookshops. And if I had to pick a favorite in the latter category, it's Dog Ears Book Barn in the little town of Hoosick, N.Y. Conveniently, it's just a little ways down Route 7 from the Man of Kent, one of America's best bars.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0273a33607950225cc804b6b0df8a694a29cdeef.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cuba on the Edge of Change</h1><p>at times can feel like a nation abandoned. The aching disrepair of its cities, the untamed foliage of its countryside, the orphaned coastlines - a half-century of isolation has wrapped the country in decay. Yet few places in the world brim with as much life as Cuba, a contrast drawn sharper amid its faded grandeur.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/fadd80fef63f3704329bd8f3effa0b99/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=548&cropwidth=1050&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F196de034f71ac2612a2898c9ace08482d0e1afa6.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>dinnertable: A 20-Seat Speakeasy-Style Restaurant</h1><p>The sign beside the interior door reads "Press for Food." If you're in front of it, you've just walked through the bustling East Village cocktail bar The Garret East, beyond a curtain, into a petite corridor. A push of the analog button sends a chime to the inside and you're promptly greeted.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/682b41fef064cf8db469586081efdcf85b09289c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
